## Installation

To get started with the project, you need to have Node.js and npm installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webgl-fluid-simulation.git
   cd webgl-fluid-simulation
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To run the project locally, use the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. The application will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

- **public/**: Contains the public assets and the main HTML file.
- **src/**: Contains the source code of the application.
  - **components/**: Contains the React components used in the application.
  - **App.js**: The main application component.
  - **index.js**: The entry point of the application.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Three.js**: A 3D library that makes WebGL simpler.
- **@react-three/fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js.
- **fluid-canvas**: A library for creating fluid simulations on a canvas.
- **fluid-simulation-react**: A React component for fluid simulation.
- **webgl-fluid**: A WebGL-based fluid simulation library.
- **@babel/runtime**: Babel's modular runtime helpers.
- **@emotion/react** and **@emotion/styled**: Libraries for writing CSS styles with JavaScript.
- **@mui/material**: Material-UI, a popular React UI framework.
- **typescript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## Features

- **Interactive Fluid Simulation**: Users can interact with the fluid simulation using mouse or touch inputs.
- **Real-time Rendering**: The simulation runs in real-time, providing a smooth and responsive experience.
- **Modern UI**: Built with React and Material-UI for a modern and responsive interface.
